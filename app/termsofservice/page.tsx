            Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how we collect, use, and share personal information about you. By submitting data through the Service, you expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal data in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

            Sponsorless reserves the right to change or modify this Agreement at any time and in our sole discretion.

          <h3 className="ml-[2rem]">2. Our Service</h3>
          <p>
            a. The Service is a software application made available by Sponsorless to, among other things, enable users of the Service ("Users") to mint unique non-fungible tokens (collectively, "NFTs"), implemented on the Ethereum or Polygon blockchain (the "Blockchain Platform") using smart contracts. You may only participate in the minting of any NFT by linking an electronic wallet that allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using cryptocurrency and NFTs (each, a "Digital Wallet") on supported bridge extensions. Before minting an NFT, you must connect and unlock your Digital Wallet through the Service. Once you submit an order to mint an NFT, your order is passed on through the Digital Wallet to the applicable bridge extension, which completes the transaction on the Blockchain Platform on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. Sponsorless may, in its sole discretion, elect to provide support
            services to Users, but Sponsorless has no obligation to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            c. ALL TRANSACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH OUR SERVICE ARE EFFECTED BY
            THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL WALLET EXTENSIONS. BY USING OUR SERVICES, YOU
            AGREE THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE
            AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE APPLICABLE EXTENSIONS.
          </p>

          <h3 className="ml-[2rem]">3. User Representations and Warranties</h3>
          <p>
            a. You must be eighteen (18) years old to use the Service. By using
            the Service, you agree to (i) provide accurate, current, and
            complete information about yourself, (ii) maintain and promptly
            update from time to time as necessary such information, (iii)
            maintain the security of your Digital Wallet and accept all risks of
            unauthorized access to your Digital Wallet and the information you
            provide to us, and (iv) immediately notify us if you discover or
            otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your use of the
            Service.
          </p>
          <p>b. You agree that you will not:</p>

              written permission;
            </p>
            <p>
              log in or try to log in to access the Service through unauthorized
              third party applications or clients.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            C. Sponsorless may require you to provide additional information and
            documents from time to time, including without limitation at the
            request of any competent authority or in order to help Sponsorless
            comply with applicable law, regulation, or policy, including laws
            related to anti-laundering (legalization) of incomes obtained by
            criminal means, or for counteracting financing of terrorism.
            Sponsorless may also require you to provide additional information
            and documents in cases where it has reasons to believe that: (i)
            your Digital Wallet or other access to the Service is being used for
            money laundering or for any other illegal activity; (ii) you have
            concealed or reported false identification information and other
            details; or (iii) transactions effected via your Digital Wallet were
            effected in breach of this Agreement. In such cases, Sponsorless, in
            its sole discretion, may pause or cancel your transactions until
            such requested additional information and documents have been
            reviewed by Sponsorless and accepted as satisfying the requirements
            of applicable law, regulation, or policy. If you do not provide
            complete and accurate information and documents in response to such
            a request, Sponsorless may refuse to provide any NFT, Content (as
            defined below), product, service and/or further access to the
            Service to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            d. When you use the Service, you hereby represent and warrant, to
            and for the benefit of Sponsorless, its affiliates, and its and
            their respective representatives, as follows: You are sophisticated,
            experienced and knowledgeable regarding NFTs. Additionally, you have
            conducted an independent investigation of the Service and the
            matters contemplated by these Terms, have formed your own
            independent judgment regarding the benefits and risks of and
            necessary and desirable practices regarding the foregoing, and, in
            making the determination to use the Service, you have relied solely
            on the results of such investigation and such independent judgment.
            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you understand,
            acknowledge and agree that the legal requirements pertaining to
            blockchain technologies and digital assets generally, including the
            NFTs, are uncertain, and you have conducted an independent
            investigation of such potentially applicable legal requirements and
            the resulting risks and uncertainties, including the risk that one
            or more governmental entities or other persons may assert that any
            digital assets or cryptographic tokens (including the NFTs) may
            constitute securities under applicable legal requirements. You
            hereby irrevocably disclaim and disavow reliance upon any statements
            or representations made by or on behalf of, or information made
            available by, Sponsorless, in determining to enter into this
            Agreement, mint any NFT, or otherwise use the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            e. You must provide all equipment and software necessary to connect
            to the Service. You are solely responsible for any fees, including
            Internet connection or mobile fees, that you incur when accessing
            the Service.
          </p>

          <h3 className="ml-[2rem]">4. Minting the NFT</h3>
          <p>
            a. By minting an NFT, you agree to comply with any terms, including
            licenses or payment rights that are embedded within or otherwise
            included with any NFT that you purchase. Sponsorless does not
            guarantee that NFTs will be transferable to any other platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. Your ability to mint an NFT may be subject to certain additional
            eligibility requirements, as determined by Sponsorless in its sole
            discretion, and such requirements may be indicated on the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            c. Sponsorless may set limits or other terms regarding the sale of
            NFTs comprising Sponsorless's Content, including any fee payable in
            connection with any subsequent sale of an NFT, whether or not such
            sale takes place on or through the Service (each such sale, a
            "Secondary Sale," and such fee, a "Secondary Sale Fee"). Sponsorless
            will display such terms at the point of sale or otherwise within the
            Service (the "NFT Terms," as set forth above).
          </p>
          <p>
            d. Sponsorless is not and shall not be a party to any transaction or
            dispute between any initial minter of an NFT and any subsequent
            owner of such NFT, whether arising from any rights granted in that
            NFT or otherwise, unless otherwise set forth in connection with such
            NFT.
          </p>

          <h3 className="ml-[2rem]">5. Pricing and Fees; Payments</h3>
          <p>
            a. All pricing and payment terms for NFTs are as indicated at the
            point of sale or otherwise on the Service, and any payment
            obligations you incur are binding at the time of minting. Unless
            otherwise specified on the Service, you are solely responsible for
            any gas fees or other transaction fees associated with minting an
            NFT. You may not substitute any other currency, whether
            cryptocurrency or fiat currency, for the specified payment currency
            at the time of purchase. It is important to note that fluctuations
            in the value of any currency, whether cryptocurrency or otherwise,
            will not affect or excuse your payment obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. By minting an NFT, you acknowledge that you have read,
            understood, and agreed to be bound by any terms and conditions
            applicable to the secondary sale of that NFT, including any
            secondary sale fee (regardless of whether such fee is enforced or
            supported by the third-party platform or marketplace facilitating
            the secondary sale). Furthermore, if you sell an NFT, you are
            obligated to ensure that the purchaser of the NFT is also bound by
            the applicable secondary sale terms and conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            c. Payment processing for each NFT is facilitated by one or more
            third-party service providers, including digital wallet bridge
            extensions (referred to as "Payment Processors"). Sponsorless may
            add or change Payment Processors at its discretion. These services
            may be subject to additional terms or conditions required by the
            respective Payment Processor. If you do not have the necessary
            rights to use a particular Payment Processor, you may be unable to
            access and utilize the Services.
          </p>

          <h3 className="ml-[2rem]">6. Consent to Electronic Communication</h3>
          <p>
            By contacting Sponsorless via email, signing up to be white-listed
            for a sale of NFTs, or by using the Service, you consent to receive
            electronic communications from Sponsorless (e.g., via email, SMS, or

            disclosures, and other communications that Sponsorless provides to
            you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
            communications would fulfill if they were in writing. This includes
            compliance with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National
            Commerce Act at 15 U.S.C. §7001 et seq. ("E-Sign").
          </p>

            or any third-party properties. If you are a resident of California,
            you expressly waive the provisions of California Civil Code Section
            1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims
            that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to
            exist in their favor at the time of executing the release, and that
            if known by them would have materially affected their settlement
            with the debtor or released party." By agreeing to this provision,
            you acknowledge that you have been made aware of the existence of
            California Civil Code Section 1542 and expressly waive its
            applicability to any and all claims released under this Agreement.
          </p>

          <h3 className="ml-[2rem]">14. Assumption of Risk Related to NFTs</h3>
          <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
          <p>
            a. The prices of NFTs and other digital assets are highly volatile.
            Fluctuations in the price of digital assets could have a significant
            negative impact on the value of NFTs. We cannot guarantee that
            purchasers of NFTs will not experience financial losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. It is your sole responsibility to determine the tax implications
            of your transactions involving NFTs. Sponsorless and its entities
            are not responsible for determining the taxes that may apply to NFT
            transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            c. NFTs exist and can be transferred only through the ownership
            record maintained on the blockchain supporting those NFTs.
          </p>
          <p>
            d. There are risks associated with using digital currency and
            digital assets, including but not limited to the risk of hardware
            and software malfunctions, Internet connection issues, the
            introduction of malicious software, unauthorized access to your
            information by third parties, and the risk of purchasing counterfeit
            or mislabeled assets, assets with metadata decay vulnerabilities,
            assets on smart contracts with bugs, or assets that may become
            untransferable.
          </p>
          <p>
            e. Upgrades, hard forks, failures, or changes in the confirmation
            process of the underlying blockchain platform may have unintended
            adverse effects on all blockchains utilizing such technologies,
            including your transactions involving NFTs purchased on Sponsorless.
          </p>
          <p>
            f. The legal and regulatory landscape concerning blockchain
            technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is evolving. New
            regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on the
            development of the Service and NFTs.
          </p>

          <h3 className="ml-[2rem]">15. Indemnification</h3>

            entities from and against all actual or alleged third-party claims,

            attorneys' fees and expenses), and costs (including, without
            limitation, court costs, costs of settlement, and costs associated
            with pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every kind and
            nature whatsoever arising out of or related to this Agreement or
            your use of the Service, whether known or unknown, foreseen or
            unforeseen, matured or unmatured, or suspected or unsuspected, in
            law or equity, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise
            (collectively, "Claims"), including but not limited to damages to
            property or personal injury, that are caused by, arise out of, or
            are related to:

            without limitation, any act or omission involving any third party in

            to furnish, or any acts or omissions of or attributable to you or
            any third party in respect of the same).
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree to promptly notify Sponsorless of any third-party Claims
            and cooperate with Sponsorless and its affiliated entities in
            defending such Claims. You further agree that Sponsorless and its
            affiliated entities shall have control of the defense or settlement
            of any third-party Claims. THIS INDEMNITY IS IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT
            IN LIEU OF, ANY OTHER INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN A SEPARATE WRITTEN
            AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND SPONSORLESS.
